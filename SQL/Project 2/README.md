### Title: Data Cleaning and Analysis Project

**Introduction:**
The aim of this project was to perform comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the "layoffs" dataset. The dataset contains information about layoffs, including company details, industry, location, total laid off, percentage laid off, date, funding stage, and country. The project involved identifying and addressing data quality issues, standardizing data formats, handling missing values, and conducting exploratory analysis to derive insights.

**Methods:**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Duplicates were removed to ensure data integrity.
   - Data standardization was performed to ensure consistency across fields.
   - Null values were handled appropriately based on data context.
   - Unnecessary columns were removed to streamline the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Summary statistics were calculated to understand the distribution of total layoffs, percentage laid off, and other relevant variables.
   - Various analyses were conducted, including layoffs by company, industry, year, funding stage, and country, to gain insights into the dataset.
   - Time series analysis was performed to identify trends and patterns in layoffs over time.
   
3. **Rolling Total Function:**
   - A function was developed to calculate rolling totals of layoffs, providing a dynamic view of layoffs over time.

4. **Top 5 Companies by Year:**
   - The top 5 companies with the highest layoffs for each year were identified and ranked based on the total number of layoffs.

**Results:**
- Data cleaning operations successfully improved data quality and consistency.
- Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into layoffs across different dimensions such as company, industry, year, and country.
- The rolling total function provided a valuable tool for monitoring layoffs over time.
- The identification of top 5 companies by year highlighted key players in terms of layoffs within each year.

**Conclusion:**
The project effectively addressed data quality issues, provided valuable insights into layoffs, and laid the foundation for further analysis and decision-making. The cleaned and analyzed dataset can serve as a basis for future research, predictive modeling, and strategic planning in the context of layoffs and workforce management.

**Future Work:**
Future work could involve more advanced analytics such as predictive modeling to forecast layoffs, sentiment analysis on layoff announcements, and deeper exploration of factors influencing layoffs within specific industries or regions. Additionally, incorporating external datasets such as economic indicators or industry trends could enhance the analysis and provide a broader context for understanding layoffs.
